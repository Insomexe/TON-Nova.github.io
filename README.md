Blockchain technology is a decentralized, secure and unalterable digital ledger system. Each block contains transactions that took place during a certain period of time and also includes the hash of the previous block. In this way, the blocks are cryptographically connected to each other, which ensures the security of the data.

The blocks are connected to each other in chains, and each node keeps a copy of the same digital ledger. Hash functions convert data into a fixed-size output and make it possible to connect blocks together. Consensus mechanisms ensure that all nodes in the network agree on the accuracy of transactions. The most common mechanisms are the Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS) systems.

When a user starts a transaction on the network, the nodes verify the transaction. The verified transactions create a new block and are added to this blockchain. The new block is distributed to all nodes and the ledger is updated.

Blockchain technology is used in many areas such as digital currencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, smart contracts, supply chain management, voting systems and digital authentication. The decentralized nature of blockchain suggests that it will become even more widespread in the future, offering transparency, security and efficiency.

# What is TON (The Open Network) Infrastructure ?

TON (The Open Network) is a scalable and secure blockchain platform originally developed by Telegram and later maintained by an independent community. TON aims to support large-scale applications with high processing speeds and low costs.

TON's multichain structure supports multiple chains (shard chain) and increases the network's parallel processing capacity. This ensures high performance and scalability. The dynamic sharding mechanism offers the ability to automatically split into parts and reassemble according to the network load, which improves efficiency.

TON uses the hypercube routing algorithm to route data on the network quickly and efficiently. This ensures low latency and high data transfer rate. The Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism uses staking validators to verify transactions and ensure the security of the network. Turing complete smart contracts allows developers to create complex and customized smart contracts.

TON has a wide range of uses such as fast and low-cost micropayments, decentralized applications (dApps), secure data storage, decentralized internet services (DNS, VPN) and e-commerce.

TON's high performance, security, low costs and flexibility make it an ideal platform for developing a wide range of decentralized applications and services. TON infrastructure opens the door to more innovation and development in the future by maximizing the possibilities offered by blockchain technology.

# What is Novacoin and what does it offer you ?
As the pioneer of Technology and Industry 4.0, we are committed to signing groundbreaking projects in our country and around the world. In this context, we have developed Novacoin, which is based on TON infrastructure and takes the power of blockchain technology behind it. Novacoin is not only an investment tool, but also an investment in the future of technology.

The Power of Blockchain Technology
Blockchain has a secure, transparent and decentralized structure. This technology is revolutionizing financial transactions, as well as data security, supply chain management and many other areas. Novacoin is one of the most innovative examples of this revolution. The advantages offered by blockchain technology:

Security: Every transaction is recorded in a non-changeable and transparent way.
Decentralization: Direct transactions can be made without the need for intermediary agents.
Speed and Efficiency: Faster and cost-effective operations compared to traditional methods.

The difference of Novacoin 
The main goal of the NOVA Coin project is to become a global paying unit and be used in the free market and technology and industry development around the world. In line with this goal, NOVA Coin aims to play an active role in the following areas:

Global Trade: To provide a fast, secure and low-cost paying method in international trade.
Technological Innovation: To provide financing for innovative technological projects and to support technological development.
Industrial Development: To contribute to the financing of industrial projects and to encourage innovative solutions in this field.
